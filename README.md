# mcpi-player-skin-editor

Still not working yet <br />
Everything is glitchy and weird <br />
`index.html` works but you can't import export file, you can only see a steve floating <br />
`fileupload.html` does not work but you can upload your texture to see it on the model but it is not mapping properly
